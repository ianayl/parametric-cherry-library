# [WIP] Parametric Cherry Library

This OpenSCAD library intends to be able to generate cherry profiled keycaps
intended for 3D printing: keycaps will be printed vertically to encourage
better print quality

Goals for the future:

- FIX weird ledge as a result of `hull()` (consider chaining `hull()`'s)
- Create stems
- Entertain the idea of generating separate stems for better 3D printing
- Add support for custom legends
